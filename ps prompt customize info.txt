I'm using prompt.ps1 to customize my PS prompt via the 
Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1
in the parent powershell folder

I wanted to use a separate file with the script instead of pasting it into the Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1 file directly
i asked GPT about it and she said to put it in a subfolder so that's what i did


--------------
The Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1 file is typically used as the profile script for the PowerShell console and ISE. It loads automatically when you start a new PowerShell session.

If you want to organize your custom scripts, including your prompt.ps1, you can follow these steps:

Profile Script Location:

Find the location of your profile script using $profile. Common locations are:
Current user, current host: $HOME\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1
All users, current host: $HOME\Documents\PowerShell\profile.ps1
Create a Custom Folder:

Create a folder (e.g., "Scripts") in the same directory as your profile script.
Move or Copy Your Scripts:

Move or copy your custom scripts, including prompt.ps1, into the "Scripts" folder.
Update Profile Script:

Open your profile script (Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1) in a text editor.

Add the following lines to import your custom scripts:

powershell
Copy code
# Import custom scripts
$customScriptsFolder = Join-Path (Split-Path $profile) "Scripts"
Get-ChildItem -Path $customScriptsFolder -Filter "*.ps1" | ForEach-Object { . $_.FullName }
Save the changes.

Reload Profile:

Close and reopen your PowerShell session, or manually reload the profile using:
powershell
Copy code
. $profile
Now, your custom scripts, including prompt.ps1, will be imported and available in your PowerShell session. This way, you can organize your scripts in a separate folder for better management.
